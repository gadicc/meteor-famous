Temporary package for Famo.us Mixed Mode v0.5.0

I won't be maintaining this package, it's just for people who want to get up
and running with the new mixed mode quickly (including glsl shaders).

I suggest to:

* Use Famous via [raix:famono](https://atmospherejs.com/raix/famono) once https://github.com/Famous/engine/issues/152 is fixed.
* Wait for new version of [mjn:famous](https://atmospherejs.com/mjn/famous)
* Use Famous via [cosmos:browserify](https://atmospherejs.com/cosmos/browserify) once https://github.com/Famous/engine/issues/152 is fixed.
* Use Famous via [rocket:module](https://atmospherejs.com/rocket/module) once https://github.com/Famous/engine/issues/152 is fixed.
